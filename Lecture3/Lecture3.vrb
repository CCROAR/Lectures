\begin{itemize}
  \item Take aways from the example
  \bigskip
  \item Classical econometrics set up, choosing between smaller and larger models
  \bigskip
  \item More complexity, the prediction error keeps getting smaller.
  \bigskip
  \item The choice of a model's complexity faces a bias/variance trade-off.
  \bigskip
  \item Open question: how to find the optimal complexity level? \\ {\tiny (later on the course)}
